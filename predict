# Real Estate Price Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting real estate prices based on various factors like building area, parking area, and total price using Random Forest and other machine learning models. The model was trained on real estate transaction data, optimized through GridSearchCV, and evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This project is designed to be reproducible and submitted on Kaggle for ranking purposes.

## Introduction

Real estate price prediction is a challenging problem due to the influence of many factors like location, building area, parking area, and more. This project leverages machine learning to predict real estate prices using historical transaction data.

We employ **Random Forest** as the base model and fine-tune it using **GridSearchCV** for better accuracy. The evaluation metric is **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and the model is tested on a Kaggle submission.

## Model Description

- **RandomForestRegressor**: Used as the core model for prediction.
- **GridSearchCV**: For hyperparameter tuning.
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate model performance.

### Key Hyperparameters:
- `n_estimators`: Number of trees in the forest.
- `max_depth`: Maximum depth of the tree.
- `min_samples_split`: Minimum number of samples required to split a node.
- `max_features`: Number of features considered for the best split.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd real-estate-prediction
    ```

3. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Run

1. Preprocess the data:
   - Ensure your dataset is in the correct format, and data columns like `單價元平方公尺`, `建物移轉總面積平方公尺`, etc., are properly processed.
   - Use the provided scripts to clean the data.

2. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

3. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

4. Save and submit results to Kaggle:
    - Results will be automatically saved as `submission.csv`.

    ```bash
    kaggle competitions submit -c <competition-name> -f submission.csv -m "First submission"
    ```

## Results

- **Best Parameters**: {'max_depth': None, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 500}
- **Validation Mean Absolute Error**: 95,833.37

## Kaggle Submission

## Report

### Model Tuning Process:
We tested several models and hyperparameters to optimize prediction accuracy. Initially, we used default parameters and then performed grid search to fine-tune parameters like `n_estimators`, `max_features`, and `min_samples_split`.

### Challenges:
The model was sensitive to certain features, particularly `建物移轉總面積平方公尺` and `單價元平方公尺`. Fine-tuning hyperparameters with `GridSearchCV` significantly improved model performance but still left some room for improvement.
